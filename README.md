# Car-C++-Class
This is a lesson about making a car class that uses a constructor to ask the user what the model is and save it to the Car's license-plate variable.

See car.cpp for the full code but I will put it here as well.

This is just a fun project and relatively for people who are really new to C++!

See my other projects as well; I made a Python password thingy.
